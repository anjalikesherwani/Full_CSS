            Programming, often referred to as coding, is the process
            of creating instructions that computers, phones, and other
            electronic devices can follow. These instructions, or code,
            are written in a variety of languages that computers can
            understand. When you program, you're essentially having a
            conversation with the computer, telling it exactly what you
            want it to do.
        </p>
<p>As a beginner, you might find the world of programming vast and a 
    bit overwhelming. But don't worry, everyone starts somewhere. 
    Programming is a skill that can be learned, and with practice 
    and patience, you'll find yourself creating your own applications,
     solving problems, and even making games. It's a creative process 
     that's as much about thinking 
    and problem-solving as it is about writing code.</p>
